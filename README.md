# BionformHer-Module-2-Mini-Project

Evolutionary Conservation of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) Gene
Project Overview
This repository contains my submission for the BioinformHer Module 2 Mini Project, which explores the evolutionary conservation of the Hemoglobin Beta (HBB) gene across multiple species using basic bioinformatics tools. The project applies sequence retrieval, alignment, visualization, and phylogenetic analysis techniques learned in Module 2.

Objectives
The main goals of this project were to:

Retrieve homologous HBB gene sequences from different species

Perform pairwise and multiple sequence alignments

Visualize conserved regions using sequence logos

Construct a phylogenetic tree to infer evolutionary relationships

Document and present findings clearly and reproducibly

Tools and Resources Used
The following freely available bioinformatics tools were used:

NCBI BLAST – sequence retrieval and homology search

Clustal Omega / MUSCLE – multiple sequence alignment

Skylign – sequence logo generation

MEGA X – phylogenetic tree construction

GitHub – project documentation and version control
